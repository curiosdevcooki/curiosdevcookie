<h3 id="hi-there-">Hi there 👋</h3>
<p>My name is Ari, nice to meet you!</p>
<ul>
<li>🖼 I’m currently working on my first Portfolio as a Software-Engineer</li>
<li>🐇 I’m currently learning how to resist at least some rabbit-holes that are functional programming</li>
<li>💪 I&#39;d love to gain some work experience in functional programming</li>
<li>🧱 I’m looking for someone to talk tech with</li>
<li>💬 Ask me about: whatever is on your mind, shoot</li>
<li>📫 How to reach me: Twitter @curiosdevcookie</li>
<li>😄 How my name sounds: like Mary minus M</li>
<li>📚 Fun fact: I&#39;m a passionate carpenter</li>
</ul>
<p>Before finding myself waist-deep in the nerdiness of Software Engineering, I was more of a geek and to this day I&#39;m still recovering from being a PhD-student of Ancient History.</p>
<p>However… loving languages like Latin and Ancient Greek comes in handy, drawing comparisons between German, French and English is fun, and provides necessary stamina and curiosity for learning programming languages as well.</p>
